# Dart Asynchronous Programming Error: Incomplete Exception Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart asynchronous programming: neglecting to properly handle exceptions that may occur during network operations or other asynchronous tasks.

The `bug.dart` file contains code that attempts to fetch data from an API. However, it only handles the `200 OK` response code, leaving other error conditions unaddressed. This can lead to unexpected application crashes or silent failures.

The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a corrected version of the code that addresses this issue by implementing comprehensive exception handling using `try-catch` blocks.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in asynchronous code for building reliable and stable Dart applications.
